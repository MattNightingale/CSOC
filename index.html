    <h2>
      History
    </h2>
    <p>With the emphasis on sportiness and driving dynamics, the Clubsport model sits neatly between the 330Ci Sport model and the legendary M3 Coupe.

      Easily distinguished by its distinctive new rear M spoiler, other exterior additions include sports suspension settings and exclusive 18 inch double spoke alloy wheels. Acoustics have also undergone change 20 kgs of insulation material has been removed to increase engine sound.
      
      The interior reflects the sporty character of the exterior. Leather/alcantara sports seats, shortened M gear lever, door sill with Clubsport model designation and special silver aluminium cubed interior trim are fitted as standard and create a sense of driving precision.</p>
    <p>
      The E46 Clubsport arrived in 2002 and represented one of the final changes made to the E46 line-up prior to its facelift. Based on the 330Ci Sport, the E46 330Ci Clubsport was mechanically identical to the 330Ci Sport but gained carbon fibre splitters and a rear spoiler. A choice of two non-standard colours where made available, Velvet or Estoril Blue, alongside a rare Titan Silver. Inside, the Clubsport got a short-shift gear lever, unique alloy interior trims and sill plates, the centre armrest was deleted while electric leather seats were standard issue. Style 71 split rim M doublespoke alloys were fitted to each corner and there was also a reduction in engine bay sound deadening material, Sport suspension toughened the ride. Interestingly, in some markets, the Clubsport pack (code S768A) could be added to models other than the 330Ci Sport – such as the 320Ci. Available from 2002 to 2005 when the E46 was replaced, Clubsport cars were built as ‘Individual Series’ cars rather than being built in limited runs, this means that specifications of non-330Ci cars can vary.
